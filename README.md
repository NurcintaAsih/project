# Bike Rentals Dashboard 
Bike rental dashboard is one of the final projects of data analysis in python. I will analyze and create a dashboard from the bike sharing dataset. In the book notes file I have attached how I carry out analysis from Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. Apart from that, I also made a dashboard using Streamlit. 
#Project work cycle
1. Data Wrangling :
   * Gathering data
   * Assessing data
   * Cleaning data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   * Defined business questions for data exploration
   * Create data Exploration
3. Data Visualization:
   * Create Data Visualizations that answer business questions
4. Dashboard
   * Prepare the DataFrame to be used
   * Create a filter component on the dashboard
   * Complete the dashboard with various data visualizations.
In creating data wrangling and data visualization, there are several steps that must be prepared, namely:
   * Open your favorite IDE such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (but here I will use Google Colab).
   * Create a New Notebook.
   * Upload and select the file with the .ipynb extension.
   * Connecting to a hosted runtime.
   * Finally, run the code cell.
In creating a dashboard, there are several steps that must be prepared
* Install Streamlit in the terminal or command prompt using pip install streamlit
* install other libraries such as pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn if you haven't already done so/have them
5. Screenshoot
